Examples
========

The best way to learn how to use StructureBoost is by working through examples. As such, we have created numerous Jupyter notebooks on a variety of data sets to illustrate the capabilities.

The full set of examples can be found `here`_.  The descriptions are below.

#. `CA_County_Classification`_: A straightforward example of how to configure and use StructureBoost for a classification problem.  Also contains a comparison to other boosting packages.
#. `CA_County_Regression`_: Like the previous notebook, but for a regression example.
#. `CA_County_Deep_Dive`_: A lengthier exploration of the CA County weather data, highlighting other ways that Categorical Structure can be extremely important.
#. `MoCap_Spatial`_: An example using the **graphical_voronoi** feature type on 3d sensor data detecting hand postures.
