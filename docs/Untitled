How to handle missing values in categorical variables

Approach 1:  Tell users to pre-process and map the NAs to named categorical variables.
              Add to configuration a designation of values to be treated as missing
              Modify code to treat the missing values appropriately

Approach 2:  "Under the hood" data replacement.  Same as approach 1, but we don't require them to change the data
            If there are missing values in a designated categorical variable, we will fill in the value (non-destructively)
            and then just run the same modified code as in Approach 1.

Approach 3:  Deal with the NA's as we see them more directly.

Other issues: Can we handle missing values in categorical int?  or will it choke because np.nan is a float and doesn't play nice with ints.
